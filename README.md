# log_parse_ruby

Quick little log parser for domain-specific web logs.

You will need to create a log file called ``my.log`` and fill it with your log in the correct format.

There's also a handy little IP log to csv converter script in here. Assuming you have ``curl``, ``sed``, and ``perl`` installed, it should run on any POSIX system 👍.
